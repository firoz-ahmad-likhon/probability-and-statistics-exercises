## Introduction
A collection of exercises and practice problems on probability and statistics using Python. Covers concepts like probability distributions, hypothesis testing, regression, and more.

## Prerequisites
- python (updated) installed
- pip installed

## DEVELOPMENT
1. Clone the repository
2. Create a virtual environment `python -m venv .venv`
3. Activate the virtual environment `source .venv/bin/activate
`. In Windows, use `.venv\Scripts\activate` instead.
4. Install dependencies `pip install -r requirements.txt`
5. Run the code `python file_name.py`

### The repository contains the following practices:
